This folder contains 2 spreadsheets that details parts for the project.

OrderForm.xlsx contains parts that were ordered for the project (with a couple of exceptions listed in the sheet).

CameraReplicationParts.xlsx contains parts that we were going to order in order to create 2 more cameras. Due to the COVID-19 suspension, the team decided to forgo ordering the parts. However, CameraReplicationParts.xls gives a good idea of what is necessary to build a camera unit in terms of hardware.
